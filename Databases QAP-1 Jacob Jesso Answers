QAP-1 Term-3 Jacob Jesso
Date: January 17th 2024 


1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? "Roughly 5-7 of being infront of my Computer"
(Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of 
this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)


2. What online resources you have used? "W3 Schools along with two of your lectures"
(My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)


3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. "No I didn't want to ask any questions but i should've"
(If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)


4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? "Same answer as question 3 But No"
If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?


5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, 
and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem 
requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.

The question by any standards weren't particularily hard it's just they were more repetitive and time consuming then anything!
